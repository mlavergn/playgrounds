# Swift Playgrounds

This is a collection of Swift 4 playgrounds. I use them as the starting point for validating concepts or playing with new APIs. These are very organic, there's no timeline as to when or why these are added.

These are _not intended for production use_, there are forced unwraps and error handling consists of printing an error to stdout. These are merely convenient launch points for exploring APIs. 

I converted this to a public repo in the event that some of the usage examples might be useful to others. The playgrounds are *lightly* scrubbed and I truncated the history to remove any non-public information.

NOTE: My swiftutil project has proper classes that are more production ready for some of these playground "topics".
